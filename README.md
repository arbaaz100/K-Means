# K-Means
K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation
It is a program demonstrating the Implementation of K-Means Algorithm
It Takes Input from user:-
  1. Number of Clusters - k
  2. Number of Iterations - itr
It sets different labels that are equal to number of clusters to each and every data point
After which it recalculates Mean centroids of different plotted labels
Then it iterates the recalculation and again assign new labels to the data points
Atlast, it plots a graph through matplotlib and display it
